== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I create my maps? =

All maps can be created on www.mapjam.com where a user simply creates a free account and can access their maps database.

= Where can I learn how to make a map? =

Head to support.mapjam.com for video and text solutions to map making.

= How does the shortcode work? =

The shortcode has only the id attribute set, or the custom URL that you have reserved for your map.

Ex. [mapjam id="MapURL"]

= How can I change the default options for my map shortcode? =

These settings can be changed in the edit section of your map on mapjam.com

To bypass the default map options, you will have to include a complete attribute set for both interactive and static maps.  This includes: 
- Zoom Level
- Latitude and Longitude
- Enable/Disable Cluster (For interactive maps)
- Set Dimensions (px)

Ex. [mapjam id="ggpark" zoom="10" lat="37.753344" long="-122.397995" cluster="8" width="500" height="300"]
